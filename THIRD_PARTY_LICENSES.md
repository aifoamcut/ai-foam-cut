 The PyInstaller licensing terms
================================
 

Copyright (c) 2010-2023, PyInstaller Development Team
Copyright (c) 2005-2009, Giovanni Bajo
Based on previous work under copyright (c) 2002 McMillan Enterprises, Inc.


PyInstaller is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,
or (at your option) any later version.


Bootloader Exception
--------------------

In addition to the permissions in the GNU General Public License, the
authors give you unlimited permission to link or embed compiled bootloader
and related files into combinations with other programs, and to distribute
those combinations without any restriction coming from the use of those
files. (The General Public License restrictions do apply in other respects;
for example, they cover modification of the files, and distribution when
not linked into a combined executable.)
 
 
Bootloader and Related Files
----------------------------

Bootloader and related files are files which are embedded within the
final executable. This includes files in directories:

./bootloader/
./PyInstaller/loader


Run-time Hooks
----------------------------

Run-time Hooks are a different kind of files embedded within the final
executable. To ease moving them into a separate repository, or into the
respective project, these files are now licensed under the Apache License,
Version 2.0.

Run-time Hooks are in the directory
./PyInstaller/hooks/rthooks


The PyInstaller.isolated submodule
----------------------------------

By request, the PyInstaller.isolated submodule and its corresponding tests are
additionally licensed with the MIT license so that it may be reused outside of
PyInstaller under GPL 2.0 or MIT terms and conditions -- whichever is the most
suitable to the recipient downstream project. Affected files/directories are:

./PyInstaller/isolated/
./tests/unit/test_isolation.py


About the PyInstaller Development Team
--------------------------------------

The PyInstaller Development Team is the set of contributors
to the PyInstaller project. A full list with details is kept
in the documentation directory, in the file
``doc/CREDITS.rst``.

The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:
https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller.  As of 2021, it consists of:

* Hartmut Goebel
* Jasper Harrison
* Bryan Jones
* Brenainn Woodsend
* Rok Mandeljc

Our Copyright Policy
--------------------

PyInstaller uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to PyInstaller. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus,
the PyInstaller source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single
person or institution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire
PyInstaller Development Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain
a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they
should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they
commit the change to the PyInstaller repository.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms:


#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copyright (c) 2005-2023, PyInstaller Development Team.
#
# Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (version 2
# or later) with exception for distributing the bootloader.
#
# The full license is in the file COPYING.txt, distributed with this software.
#
# SPDX-License-Identifier: (GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Bootloader-exception)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


For run-time hooks, the following banner should be used:

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copyright (c) 2005-2023, PyInstaller Development Team.
#
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
#
# The full license is in the file COPYING.txt, distributed with this software.
